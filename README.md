WordWise
=========


Fork By Voracious

Voracious is a chrome extension that displays definitions of tough words. Inspired by [Kindle Word-Wise](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1002989731)

[How I went about it](https://medium.com/@sanchitgn/porting-kindle-word-wise-to-the-browser-7e21e04d066c)

## Installation:

Fetch all the dependencies by running `$ yarn`.
